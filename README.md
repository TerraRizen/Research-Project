# This code is part of the CSE3000 Research Project course at TU Delft.

# Prerequisites
This project uses TensorFlow 2.10 and Python 3.10 to run.

# Creating the conda environment
Since miniconda was used for this project, you can recreate the environment using the provided environment.yml file.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Running the code
In your IDE or in command line, set the conda environment to the one you just created.
You can then run the code cell-by-cell, following the instructions in each file.

# KITTI dataset
This work used the synced and rectified KITTI dataset. To reproduce exact results, pre-trained models have been provided.
To train new models, you would need to download the synced and rectified recordings of the KITTI dataset. That can be found [here](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/index.php).
